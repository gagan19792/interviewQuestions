//Given an integer n, return a string array ans (1-indexed) where:
//
//ans[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
//ans[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
//ans[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
//ans[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
//Example
//I/P: n = 3
//O/P: ["1","2","Fizz"]
